WantIt is a revolutionary platform that empowers users to incentivize and influence others to take action using the power of blockchain technology. With WantIt, you can create a wish that targets specific individuals or organizations, and let the community come together to fund the wish and encourage the targeted parties to fulfill it.

## Why WantIt?

In today's world, many great ideas and initiatives often remain unrealized due to lack of resources or motivation. WantIt aims to change that by leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain and the collective power of the community. By creating a wish on WantIt and associating it with target addresses, you open up the possibility for others to contribute funds and incentivize the targeted parties to take action and make the wish a reality.

## Key Features

- **Wish Creation**: Easily create and publish your wishes on the WantIt platform.
- **Community Funding**: Let the community support your wishes through secure blockchain transactions.
- **Transparency**: Track the progress of your wish and see the contributions made by the community.
- **Wish Fulfillment**: Once your wish reaches its funding goal, it becomes a reality!

## Examples

1. **Convincing Elon Musk to Buy Twitter**: Encourage Elon Musk to acquire Twitter and transform it into a platform for free speech. Let the community rally behind this cause and incentivize Elon to make a bold move.

2. **Demand Apple to Go Open Source**: Urge Apple to open source their operating systems and promote transparency. Harness the power of the community to pressure Apple and advocate for a more open and collaborative tech ecosystem.

3. **Crypto Showdown: Vitalik vs. CZ**: Target Vitalik Buterin (vitalik.eth) and Changpeng Zhao (cz.eth), the influential figures behind Ethereum and Binance respectively. Dare them to engage in an epic wrestling match that will captivate the entire crypto community. Let the community pool funds to make this dream match a reality and witness the ultimate battle of blockchain titans.
